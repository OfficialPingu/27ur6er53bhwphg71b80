*Pick up the pieces.*

**Every** log, post L-02, will give a crumb. Either from within, or elsewhere.

Don't miss a crumb, it will ruin the bread.

Don't place a crumb out of order, it will ruin the bread.

The bread will contain only **decimal**, and **alphabetical**. *Capital excluded*.

None more, none less.

*Now, get baking.*

*Kurt is waiting.*
