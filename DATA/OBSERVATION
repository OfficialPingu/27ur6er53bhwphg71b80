riddle me this,
and riddle me that.
polybius this,
and polybius that.
since when had this all started?
an online myth?
an online memory?
a crazed thought,
faded from time.
the intrigue,
and the hunger for more.
but to get a foothold on the story,
you must get a foothold on the beginning.
a character, a being of conceptual existence.
that is what you must look for.
and it all starts at the beginning of polybius.
find me this character,
and your key is what shall be appended.
riddle me this,
and riddle me that.
