# Kurts' Table Documentation.
I know this may be a little off-topic for any viewers, but coincidentally - I love polybius squares. I have designed my own passworded polybius-derived cipher that I often use to communicate securely with just about anyone I feel needs secure talking to.
For in the case that might include a viewer, like you, to understand what I'm trying to tell you in dire circumstances, I have created this documentation on how to understand my cipher text.
