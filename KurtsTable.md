# Kurts' Table Documentation.
I know this may be a little off-topic for any viewers, but coincidentally - I love polybius squares. I have designed my own passworded polybius-derived cipher that I often use to communicate securely with just about anyone I feel needs secure talking to.

If a viewer like you needs to understand what I'm trying to tell you in dire circumstances, I have created this documentation on how to understand my cipher text.

To begin, I have created an online aid to help in converting polybius coordinates to characters in an alphabet, see [Kurts Table Aid](https://chib.xyz/polybius/kurttable.html).

So, how does it work with a password? Let me explain.

When I encrypt the text "this is some experimental text" using the password "password", I will get "9p8.r4 )@w5xr0/01z8582.l8%,xe@" in return.

Using the table aid link I provided above, I can convert this string into a set of coordinates, as such;

16 23 75 36 43 35 26 67 76 24 45 34 43 64 77 64 74 54 75 45 75 15 36 52 75 37 46 34 51 76
