# Polybius Data Grounds

My name is Kurt Koller and I have been documenting a recent appearance of the Polybius arcade cabinet.

My quiet town has been used as a test subject to these federal commissioners, for whatever purpose they wanted. Leaving without a trace, nor memories in those that live here. I appear to have been the only one knowing of what this cabinet holds, and the only one willing to inquire into its purpose here.

Recently, I put up a puzzle to bring in other like-minded individuals to this project.

Both to help solve the story behind this elusive arcade game, and ease the burden I have taken to solving this case.

So I guess you made it!

Did you like it?

I made sure to keep it relatively difficult to prevent the feds from "wasting resources" and finding me.

Nevertheless, I need your help. I have spent too long on this project, and am getting tired of it. But the mystery hasn't been solved. The mystery has to be solved, for all those involved. I believe I have made signifigant progress in gaining an understanding of the effects this cabinet causes to those that are unknowing of its true motive.

And that is why I have led you here.

This GitHub Repo houses all of the information I have gathered over the span this has gone on,

and now it is your turn to pick up the pieces that I have left behind.

Please, we must bring solice to those lost to the sinister nature of this cabinet.

Kurt Koller ~
