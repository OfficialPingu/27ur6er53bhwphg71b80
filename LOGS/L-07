Holy ****...

I must be dreaming.

My hypothesis has been proven false in the worst manner possible.
I saw someone die today.

By god I still can't shake the image from my head...

The boy who attempted to play the game,
His money seemed to be accepted.

He played a little while as I observed the gameplay of the console.

And...
He dropped.

As the screen went from action to "Game Over",
the boy began to seize.

Shocked and confused...
I couldn't do anything but watch.

Noone else seemed to notice what had happened,
except for three men.
Three men in black suits.

They took the boys lifeless body away from the arcade.

They were behind this...
I know it.

I tried to follow them, but I felt this gutteral sensation that hurt,
so, so bad.

I just couldn't.
I don't know why,
but I just couldn't.

I contacted the police today.
They didn't believe me.
  "A boy killed by an arcade game?"
  "You've gotta be kidding me."
  "Get outta here, creep."

Bastards...

A boy was killed today.
And you didn't bat an eye.
