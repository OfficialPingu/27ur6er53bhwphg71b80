I've been contemplating more on my recurring tendencies to want to play Polybius.

It's strange.

Deep inside,
  I know how dangerous it is.

Yet still... I have this strange urge.

This strange feeling that this is something,
  beyond satisfactory.

I think I will make an attempt tomorrow.

If the game accepts my money,
  I will end my interaction with it.

Other than these thoughts,
  nothing important to report.

Noone had tried to play the game today either.
