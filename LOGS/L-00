Today is day zero.
The beginning of something horrible, I predict.

A cabinet ha appeared,
and shocked my town to ts core.

Although, I do suppose I am the only one truy shocked,
for I have a history with this cabinet.

This cabint has brought fortune to my life.
I suppose it is time for the deal to close.

The strangest feeligs arise from this cabinet,
and I know...
I can just feel it...
It has a sinister intent.

I often visi my local arcde for the nostalgia it brings upon me.
And today,
the worst kind of nostalgia has apeared.
Polybius - has apared.

No nnouncement.
No mention o reference to it's existence.
It's just here,
and it wasn't here yesterdy.

I sure hope this is some sort of sick joke.

I plan on inquiring further tomorrow,
but for ow my hypothesis is this is some sort of marketing ploy by the owner.

The arade store hasn't been bustling like it's usd to,
that's for sure.

A location longing for it's glory days.
