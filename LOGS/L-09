It has been two days since the cabinets first victim has been claimed.

I suppose this is the length that the local law enforcment believes is sufficient for a missing persons case to be opened,
and in that - a missing persons case has been opened for the kid.

I see his face everywhere now,
on the sides of buildings,
local newspapers,
milk cartons,
etc.

Other than this, the cabinet still rejects most that approach it.

That is all I have to report.
