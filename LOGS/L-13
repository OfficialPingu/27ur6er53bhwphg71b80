--- Begin Future Kurt Note :
Prior logs were recorded via a notebook,
when I mention writing in a local digital vault,
I do not mean via GitHub, I mean storing files in a local folder on my computer.
I had not decided to make my investigation public by this point.
: End Future Kurt Note ---

I have decided to migrate my investigation to digital means,
  a digital vault per-say.

This notebook is filling up, and I cannot lose the information I have gathered.

Other than this decision,
  nothing else has come of the investigation.

Same old machine denying gameplay inquiries.
