Today is day zero.

A cabinet has appeared, and shocked my town to its core.

Although, I do suppose I am the only one truly shocked,
for I have a history with this cabinet.

This cabinet has brought fortune to my life.
I suppose it is time for the deal to close.

The strangest feelings arise from this cabinet, and I know...
I can just feel it... It has a sinister intent.

I often visit my local arcade for the nostalgia it brings upon me.
And today, the worst kind of nostalgia has appeared.
Polybius - has appeared.

No announcement.
No mention or reference to it's existence.
It's just here, and it wasn't here yesterday.

I sure hope this is some sort of sick joke.

I plan on inquiring further tomorrow, but for now my hypothesis is this is some sort of marketing ploy by the owner.
The arcade store hasn't been bustling like it's used to, that's for sure.

A location longing for it's glory days.
