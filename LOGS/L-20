i have scoped out the building.
the most secure entrance would be a back window,
of which seems often left open by employees.
it is a pretty tight fit,
and it is pretty high up,
but i believe i can get it done with a ladder.
plan of action post entrace is as follows.
1. make sure there is noone in the building.
there is a possibility that there are armed guards protecting the cabinet.
in the event that that takes place,
i will bail.
it is not worth risking my death over this cabinet.
for if it was worth the risk of death,
id have just wasted hundreds of dollars getting the machine to accept my plays.
2. now that the building is safe to roam in,
i must approach the cabinet.
i will search for screws,
nails,
latches,
or any sort of mechanism that holds the box together.
3. proceed to remove said mechanism.
4. observe?
im unsure of what i should do by this point.
alot of this plan is very sketchy.
im expecting guards.
and im expecting the cabinet to be welded shut.
perhaps in the best case scenario,
i could steal the rom board?
that would surely get the agents pissed...
and maybe bring upon my death.
but if i can get to doing that,
i will upload any and all contents i find onto the internet.
once there,
it doesnt matter if i die.
i would prolong the files life as long as possible,
get as many people to download the files as possible,
and prolong the mystery of polybius as a whole.
i believe if i leak the rom onto the internet,
i wont have to work alone.
with the masses of intrigued people,
its sure they will find something.
find an answer.
find an explanation.
and those accountable will be held accountable.
