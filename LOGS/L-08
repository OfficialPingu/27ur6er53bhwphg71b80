My head is still fuzzy.

I tried talking to the police again,
same deal.

I'll try my best to record the exact events of yesterday.

I walk in the arcade.
I set up next to a knock off pacman,
  which luckily has a perfect view of Polybius.
I play a few games,
  enjoying myself,
  observing those that attempt to play Polybius.
Kid see's the game,
  is intrigued by it's large lettering and geometric art style.
- He pulls out twenty cents, and inserts the coins.
- The game starts to my dismay.
- Bright lights are flashing in an epileptic manner,
  certainly not safe for those uninformed.
- Appears to be some sort of space shooter,
  Symbols revolving around a mother ship in the center of the screen.
  Player Space Ship rotates around the center,
  while keeping a safe distance.
  Avoiding obstacles as they fly by.
- If I am remembering correctly,
  there was alot of short-lasting imagery / text.
  -> Messages that appear for a split second,
    very similar to what is described in the urban legend.
  -> Undecipherable images...
    Strangly feeling of faces or unknown objects.
- Kid isn't very good at the game,
  as expected.
  It is his first time playing.
- Death by death,
  his remaining lives dropping lower and lower.
- And then his last remaining life is lost.
  The screen flashes fast between different shades of red, blue, or green.
  The kid drops to the floor,
    Shaking eerily unnaturally.
  "Game Over."
I stand there shocked,
  unknowing of what action needs to take place.
Three men in black suits walk around the corner,
  and silently take the body elsewhere.
I feel sick.
I make an attempt to follow,
but feel worse.
At this point,
  panic sets in.
I run,
  and I leave the arcade.
