Day Six since the appearance of a Polybius cabinet.

The cabinet still lurks silently.

Public appears to have accepted it's existence,
and I would've expected the cabinet to be gone by now.

And yet,
The cabinet still lurks silently.

I suppose I'll be observing a little while longer.

I have a feeling something is about to change.
