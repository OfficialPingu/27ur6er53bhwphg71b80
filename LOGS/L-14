It doesn't get easier.

The cabinet claimed another victim today.

Only one man claimed the body.

Same sickness felt as prior,
  but it was less intense.
I was able to follow the man.

He took the body outside of the building through a back door.

There was another man in a black car waiting.

It had one of those body beds that ambulances have,
  they pulled the bed out of a side door,
  and placed the victim on it.

Bed pulled in and door secured,
  the man entered the car,
  and they drove off.

Everything about this feels extremely fishy.

It was way too organized to be a criminal organization.

No...
For something this organized and well funded,
  it has to be government based.

I contacted the police again,
  not expecting for them to be helpful.
And they weren't.

The police recognized me and barely let me speak.
Just asked me to leave in their self-righteous attitude.
  "Alright buddy, why don't you head home."
  "We aren't interested in your conspiracy theories."

This is so stupid.

Am I the only one who sees this shit?
Noone else seems to notice the fucking corpses being taken out of the building.

It appears to me that I'm alone on this one.
And it's horrible.

My investment in this investigation can only increase at this point,
  my hatred for this exploitation of civilians has reached a point that it cannot be ignored.
