You know, it's still strange.
It's unreal.

The cabinet is quietly sitting there, untouched.

I've been monitoring the reactions of passerbyers around the game,
but no-one seems to notice its existence.

There was one kid who seemed intrigued,
by its bright lights,
its strange geometry.

This kid attempted to play the console - but it had appeared to reject his currency,
so he moved on.

Strange.

I suppose I will continue monitoring and recording my findings on this cabinet,
but for now - nothing of importance to report.
