you know, it's still strange.
it's unreal.

the caBinet is quietly sitting there, untouched.

i've been monitoring the reactions of Passerbyers around the gaMe,
but No-one seeMs to notice its existence.

there was one kid who seemed intrigued,
by its bright Lights,
its strAnge geomEtry.

thIs kid attempted to play the console - but it had appeared to reject his currency,
so he moVed on.

strange.

i suppose i will continue monitoring and recording my findings on this caBinet,
but for now - nothing of imPortance to report.

my QUest for redemption will continue.
