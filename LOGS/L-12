I tried to play the game again.
Luckily,
  it denied my attempt.

I regret attempting to interact with the cabinet.
I felt the same gutteral feeling I felt when I watched that kid be taken.

This cabinet seems to feed me a duality of intrigue and hatred.
There is something about this urban legend that just draws me in,
  but my real experiences with it are just the opposite.

I'm beginning to feel an attachment to this mystery.
I must bring consensus.

Until that day,
  I feel happy bringing this next statement to the log.

there is nothing else to report.
