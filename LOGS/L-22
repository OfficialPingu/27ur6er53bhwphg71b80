entrance of building succesful.
no guards were present, which was an interesting experience.
felt as though at any point a guard could jump out and end my life.
i made an unsuccesful attempt to open the cabinet.
many parts of the box were not only bolted shut, but welded aswell.
i will need a much more elaborate plan to succesfully learn about the internals of this box
but that should be for another day.
until then, i will continue documenting my daily observations.
